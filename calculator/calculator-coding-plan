first of all i should have two inputs firstInput and secondInput and should have one operant
between two inputs. I should create two varibles for two inputs.and need to have two true/false flags if firstInput
have a value than my firstInputFlag needs to be true and i should write another input to second secondInput
if firstInput is not true(if it doesnt have a value)then the current input should be written to firstInput;
